## App Brainstorming
*App #1:* Bloons TD Battles 
- Unique towers and bloon types that afford players a lot of variety during gameplay.
- Upbeat background music and sound design that engages you in the game/application.
- A lot of auditory cues when pressing buttons or moving back and forth between menus or gameplay itself.

*App #2:* Notion 
- Unlimited customization that allows you to combine several things (notes, habit tracker, schedules, etc) into one easily accessible space.
- Several dozen step-by-step tutorials that make navigating the application incredibly easy.

*App #3:* Apple Notes
- Allows the user to create checklists and to-do lists.
- Has rich text formatting and specifc organization like headers, subheaders, monospacing, and normal text.

*App #4:* TikTok
- Dozens of interactive challenges to engage users.
- Endless amount of music/sound integration.  

**Potential App Idea:** I would like to develop an app that is essentially a gamified habit/task tracker. The basic premise of the application would be to create tasks that act as "towers" in the world. The towers are then upgraded or made to be more extravagent the more that these tasks are completed and if a streak is developed. I would like there to be features if a players loses their streak or misses a tasks, like a feature where the tower is shown crumbling due to losing against an "opponent" aka a distraction or obstacle. Ideally, there would also be a lot of fun animations and sounds if tasks are completed, and a lot of customization in terms of what a user's world would look like.
